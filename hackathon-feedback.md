* Explanation and documentation: 50%

###  Feedback:

**Q1:**
* Good, except you hardcoded the number of "trials"
* Also, be sure to provide information about what you're printing to the terminal. 
* **code**: 2.5/3, **documentation** 2.5/3

**Q2:**
* Excellent! Good application of slicing. Could maybe add some info that you're printing to console? 
* **code**: 4/5, **documentation** 5/5

**Q3:**
* Code didn't run for me because ``cutoff`` was not defined in the function. Created a new variable to pass it to make it work. 
* Your code doesn't quite do what I wanted, because you're trimming and comparing within the function, whereas the instructions were to: 
>  Call the function on both rts and trimmed_rts.
* **code**: 3/5, **documentation** 5/5

**Q4:**
* Code works which is good.
* I like that you made ``group_rts`` as a multi-element list, but you hard-coded the values. Maybe implement a loop here?
* Similarly you're calling ``array_group[].mean()`` multiple times. Maybe implement this in a loop?
* **code**: 3/5, **documentation** 5/5

**Q5**
* Good work!
* You're not calling your methods properly though because you omitted the brackets after the call to e.g., ``mean_rts``. 
* Your method for adding a rt is hard-coded. Try to pass it a variable to build in flexibility. 
* Be sure to document your calls to the functions. 
* **code**: 3/5, **documentation** 4/5

**Q6**
* Good. 
* Be sure to close the window at the end.
* **code**: 4/4, **documentation** 4/4

:memo: **Total:** 45/54
