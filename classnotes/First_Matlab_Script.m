% Matlab uses the end keyword to terminate blocks of code 
% multi-line is %{...%}

% Defining vectors

% defined within square brackets 

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

% omit the semi colon and it prints the output to the terminal 
%clc clears the command window
%clear clears everything 

1+1

% if you do not assign a name to the variable it will create a variable
% called ans 

%% 

%creates a section 

%%

% if you type the name of the file into the command window it will execute
% all of the code

% who tells us who exists in our variables and whos provides more
% information 

% can clear specific variables from your work space via clear and the name 

% semi colons denote the columns 

% matrices must be rectangular. Must have an element at every location in a
% rectangular matrix 

% strings are in quotes 

% indexing is done with the round brackets 

% m(3,1) indexing row by column 

% m([1 3],1) taking the first and third rows from the first column 

% colon says give me everything 

% m(2:3,2) specifies a range 

% a = 1:2:10 first specifies the starting point, 2 specifies the step, and
% 10 specifies the end 

%' does a matrix transpose. takes the row and column vectors and switches
%them 

% can concatenate by adding two variables in square brackets 

% indexing a non-existent value in your matrix will extend your matrix 

%  c(6:9) = [] says to delete these values 

% zeroes, ones, and NaN, specify the dimensions of an array 

% flip will flip a matrix keeping order intact 

% multplication and division perform matrix multiplication and division 

% you can save data into mat files using the save command 

% help functions are found using help and then the name of the function 

% mean(a) will calculate the mean column wise 

% to calculate it by row transpose the variable 

% mean(a, 'all') will do it over the entire matrix 

% can reset the rng using rng('shuffle')

% matlab has imaginary numbers
