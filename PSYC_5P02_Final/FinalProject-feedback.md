* Some repetition of experiment code that could probably be put into function
:memo: **check**

#### Documentation:
* Decent documentation.  Could have included a description of the files and how to implement and run (e.g., a readme file) and/or help files
:memo: **check-/check**

#### Complexity, scale of tasks/analysis, and mastery:
* Glad to see you push yourself and get the simulated data and Fourier analysis working properly.
